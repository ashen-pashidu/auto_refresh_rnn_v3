# auto_refresh_rnn_v3
New type of RNN better than LSTM

# ðŸ§  AutoRefreshRNN_V3

An advanced **unbounded-memory recurrent neural network** that combines:
- Orthogonal recurrent dynamics  
- Adaptive auto-refresh gating  
- Compressed long-term memory attention  
- Optional local self-attention  

> Designed for efficient long-sequence learning with high gradient stability.
